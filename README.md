# D3 Boilerplate with Snowpack

This repo is a minimal setup to work on D3 visualisations.

Static assets such as the [`index.html`](/public/index.html) and the [`index.css`](/public/index.css) are located in the [`public`](/public) folder.

Your entry point for the scripts should be in the [index.js](/src/index.js) in the [`src`](/src) folder. Data to be imported by the scripts can be placed there as well.

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
